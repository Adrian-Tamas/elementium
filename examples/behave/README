This example shows how Elementium can be used with Behave (http://pythonhosted.org/behave/)

Prerequisites:

    1. Selenium

        pip install -U selenium

    2. Behave

        pip install -U behave

    3. Firefox

        https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/

To run simply run behave:

    % behave

The output you should see is something of the form:

    Feature: Behave with Elementium # features/example.feature:1

      Scenario: Show that we can run behave with elementium  # features/example.feature:3
        Given we can access the Google page                  # features/steps/steps.py:5 0.959s
        When we enter something in the search box            # features/steps/steps.py:10 0.463s
        Then we see search results                           # features/steps/steps.py:19 0.115s

    1 feature passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped
    1 scenario passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped
    3 steps passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped, 0 undefined
